I went outside as they told me to and waited there for a bit.
They were taking their time, but I guess it’s to be expected of a shortstaffed place like this.
Not that I minded, as I was very confused about it all.
So I used the opportunity to sort out my thoughts about the situation.
Apparently, I spoke to the three of them at the same time, not knowingly of course.
The thing is that I received messages coming from an anon user in the site.
But that’s just the default name for a non-registered user, so technically they could be from different persons.
But I thought they all were from just one girl!
What do I do now? This is supposed to be a date!
Just when I was starting to panic all over again I hear the door at my back opening.
I turn around to figure out who it was and…
I see the girl in the white and blue costume coming out…
And that woman dressed as a… sorcerer?
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
Jesus, how much time did they need to bring the bill to the table?
*normalLeftPosition*
Anyway, sorry about that…
Oh, I almost forgot.
*angryLeftPosition*
Did you finally talk to that weird woman at the back? The one that was staring at us all the time… 
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
Oh, you mean me, sweetie?
*happyRightPosition*
Yes, he did.
*angel*
*normalLeftPosition*
*freezes*
…
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
…
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
A-ah, uh…
I-I’m sorry… I didn’t mean-
*witch*
*happyRightPosition*
Ha, ha, ha!
It’s ok, dear. Don’t worry about that…
Besides, you’re as weird looking if you ask me.
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
…!
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
Oh, and about the conversation outcome…
*happyRightPosition*
I’m tagging along with you two.
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
W-what?! Wait, what does she mean she’s coming?
Don’t tell me…
Did you invite more than one girl to come?!
*witch*
*happyRightPosition*
I know, right?
I’ve never met anyone who was that bold in our first date.
Isn’t it thrilling, missy?
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
Hu-uh?!
What’s your damn problem, lady!?
Anyway, let’s… forget about that for now.
If we want to get to that cursed event we’ll better be on or way. And soon.
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
Sure, that is fine by me, but…
Do any of you know where the event is taking place?
I don’t know this part of the town, and I left my GPS in my car, so…
*angel*
*normalLeftPosition*
I could actually say the same.
I live and work in another town nearby, so I’m not too familiar with the place.
What about you, Kiki?
…
You don’t know it either?
*angryLeftPosition*
This is just great…
Are you telling me we are in the middle of nowhere, with no idea where we should be going…
In a three-way date, and on top of that, getting late for the main event?!
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
Oh, come on, missy! Don’t furrow your beautiful face so much.
*happyRightPosition*
You’ll get wrinkles that way.
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
W-wha-?  Who do you think you’re telling that, old hag?!
*buttons*
I’m sorry, this is all my fault.
Hey, why don’t we relax for a bit?
Hey, that was uncalled for.
*angryLeftPosition*
W-what? Ah, uh… Yeah, we know that already but this is nothing to do with you.
*angryLeftPosition*
Yes, I better do that or I’ll have a stroke.
*angryLeftPosition*
And who the hell cares about your opinion on this?!
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
Oh, I didn’t mean to offend you. 
*happyRightPosition*
It was just an advice of someone older and thus, more experienced.
Don’t take anything I say too seriously, alright missy?
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
Uh, whatever…
*normalLeftPosition*
Anyway, let’s get going.
I think I might know the place just enough to get there.
*angryLeftPosition*
I mean, it’s been awhile, but…
I think I can manage.
*witch*
*happyRightPosition*
Oh, is there any story behind it? Because I smell drama.
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
U-uh?! T-that’s…!
*buttons*
I don’t think we should pry.
Really? I think you’re overthinking it.
Yeah, what was all that about?
*happyLeftPosition*
It’s ok, there’s no story to tell. None at all!
*normalLeftPosition*
…
*angryLeftPosition*
It’s nothing, and even if it were I wouldn’t be telling you about it.
*normalLeftPosition*
Anyway, follow me.
*witch*
*happyRightPosition*
Oh my, she definitely -is- hiding something, don’t you think?
And I’m positive it’s all related to-
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
Hey, are you coming or not?
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
Yes, missy! We are just behind you.
*happyRightPosition*
…He, he!
*angel*
*normalLeftPosition*
…
…
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
…
…
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
…
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
Missy?
We are at the bar entrance…
*happyRightPosition*
…All over again.
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
I-I know that already! 
It’s just…!
I’ve just got confused for a moment and took the wrong turn, and-
*witch*
*happyRightPosition*
Hey, that’s ok, sweetheart!
There’s more of one way to get to places, isn’t it?
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
…
…Thank you.
*witch*
*happyRightPosition*
Ha, ha, ha! Don’t mention it, missy.
*normalRightPosition*
Well, boy…
Should we ask around for directions then?
*angel*
*angryLeftPosition*
…
