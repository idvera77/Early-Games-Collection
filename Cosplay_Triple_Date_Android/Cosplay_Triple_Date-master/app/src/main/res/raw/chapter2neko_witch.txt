I went outside as they told me to and waited there for a bit.
They were taking their time, but I guess it’s to be expected of a shortstaffed place like this.
Not that I minded, as I was very confused about it all.
So I used the opportunity to sort out my thoughts about the situation.
Apparently, I spoke to the three of them at the same time, not knowingly of course.
The thing is that I received messages coming from an anon user in the site.
But that’s just the default name for a non-registered user, so technically they could be from different persons.
But I thought they all were from just one girl!
What do I do now? This is supposed to be a date!
Just when I was starting to panic all over again I hear the door at my back opening.
I turn around to figure out who it was and…
 I see the girl in the cat costume coming out…
And that woman dressed as a… sorcerer?
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
Hey, sorry for the wait! 
Did you manage to convince anyone else to come with us?
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
Oh, my… Did you invite more than one girl to come?
*happyRightPosition*
That’s so… bold of you.
*normalRightPosition*
Not that I mind, if you ask me…
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
Uh? What’s that supposed to mean?
Anyway, nice to meet you!
*witch*
*happyRightPosition*
It’s… a pleasure, sweetie.
*normalRightPosition*
…
*happyRightPosition*
He, he, he…
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
…
…
…Okay
*happyLeftPosition*
Well, should we leave for the event already? It’s almost time.
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
Sure, that is fine by me, but…
Do any of you know where the event is taking place?
I don’t know this part of the town, and I left my GPS in my car, so…
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
Actually neither do I.
I told you, right? I’ve just came to town so I’m not familiar with it yet.
…Kirito?
…
You don’t know it either?
*happyLeftPosition*
Well, it’s ok! I’m sure we will make it.
*normalLeftPosition*
Somehow!
*witch*
*happyRightPosition*
…Hehe!
I wouldn’t have thought that being with kiddos would be this fun.
*neko*
*angryLeftPosition*
E-excuse me?! I’m a grown woman, you see!
You think so too, right Kirito?!
*buttons*
Yeah!
I’m sure she didn’t mean it in a bad way.
Well, you are kinda childish…
*happyLeftPosition*
Ha, ha! That’ll show you!
*normalLeftPosition*
Well, then she shouldn’t say those kind of things to people.
*angryLeftPosition*
W-what did you say?!
*witch*
*happyRightPosition*
Yes, yes! I’m sorry, missy…
…Ha, ha!
*neko*
*angryLeftPosition*
…
Ahem!
*normalLeftPosition*
Anyway, don’t worry about finding the place Kirito. I’ll take us there in a jiffy!
*happyLeftPosition*
I’ve checked our way a quintillion times on Google Street View, so I’m pretty sure I can do it. No problemo!
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
Wow, this missy has a lot of energy.
*happyRightPosition*
Okay, guide us then, kitty.
*neko*
*happyLeftPosition*
Alright! Just stick your eyes to my tail and follow my lead!
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
…
*happyRightPosition*
…So your tail, huh?
You’re asking an impossible thing, missy.
Specially for the boy here.
*buttons*
…H-huh?! *blush*
Hm? What do you mean?
Wha-?! I wouldn’t do such a thing!!
*happyRightPosition*
Ha, ha, ha, ha! You’re so fun, dear…
*normalRightPosition*
I see, so you’re the distracted kind of guy.
*angryRightPosition*
Nobody’s buying it boy, so you can save it.
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
Hm? What are you guys doing? Are you coming or not?
*witch*
*happyRightPosition*
We are on our way missy! Don’t fret…
*neko*
*angryLeftPosition*
I-I’m not fretting! It’s just you are not following me!
*witch*
*happyRightPosition*
My, my… Our stray kitty got angry.
*normalRightPosition*
Come on, boy. Let’s see where she takes us.
…
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
…
…
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
…
…
*neko*
*happyLeftPosition*
Okay guys! We are almost there.
Now we should be really close to-!
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
Kitty?
*neko*
*normalLeftPosition*
Yeah?
*witch*
*normalRightPosition*
We are at the bar entrance…
*happyRightPosition*
…All over again.
*neko*
*angryLeftPosition*
W-what?! But that’s-!
That’s impossible!
I mean, I followed the white wall, next trash cans until I counted eight of them…
Then there were these tall trees at the sides of the road and-
A-anyway, we should be there already!
*witch*
*happyRightPosition*
Ha, ha… Ah, ha, ha, ha!
Okay, I think I understand what happened now…
*normalRightPosition*
Well, boy…
Should we ask around for directions then?
*neko*
*angryLeftPosition*
Uh… *sobs*
Tap to finish...
